SECTION 1
Each of the 38 individual instruction test files counts for 2 points, for a total of 76 points. We check the final result (rdump+mdump) and the result should exactly match the reference sim. These tests are all-or-nothing.

SECTION 2
Each of the 2 hidden test files (accumulation_20.s and accumulation_210.s) counts for 3.25 points, for a total of 6.5 points. We check the final result (rdump+mdump) and the result should exactly match the reference sim. These tests are all-or-nothing.

SECTION 3
The test files are countdigits.x and fibonacci.x. Each counts for 8.75 points. We run cycle by cycle and the result (rdump + mdump) should exactly match the reference sim at each cycle. If all cycles match, full credit. Less than 3 cycles off = 8 points. More than half of the cycles correct = 4 points.  Otherwise, 0 points.  Here, if the student gets 0 or 4 points, we also check the final result and if the final result exactly matches, then the student gets an additional 1 point.

There are 100 total points possible.

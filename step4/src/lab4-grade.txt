Section 1: final result comparison

----------------------------------

br_same.s, cancel_req.s, ld.s, st_loop.s:
final result (10 each):
6 points for "No. of cycle". They lose 1 point per each 25 cycles difference. So, if the difference is X, they lose X / 25 points.
4 points for the rest of the final result.

difficult.s, example.s, ld_1.s, mem.s, test_1.s:
final result (2 each):
1 points for "No. of cycle". They lose 1 point per each 150 cycles difference. So, if the difference is X, they lose X / 150 points.
1 points for the rest of the final result.

hidden1.s:
final result (3):
2 points for "No. of cycle". They lose 1 point per each 50 cycles difference. So, if the difference is X, they lose X / 50 points.
1 points for the rest of the final result.

Section 2: cycle-by-cycle comparison

------------------------------------

Cycle-by-cycle policy:

Results (rdump and mdump) are checked, and they should exactly match the reference sim. For each test input, if the only mismatch is "Instructions Retired", 80% of the points are awarded. If all the cycles match, full points are awarded. If there are mismatches but no more than 2, 90% of the points are awarded. Otherwise, if more than 70% of the cycles match, 70% of the points are awarded. If between 40%-70% of the cycles match, 40% of the points are awarded. Otherwise, no points are awarded.

br_same.s, cancel_req.s, ld.s, st_loop.s:
cycle-by-cycle (10 each):
Policy listed above.

difficult.s, example.s, ld_1.s, mem.s, test_1.s:
cycle-by-cycle (1 each):
Policy listed above.

hidden1.s:
cycle-by-cycle (2):
Policy listed above.

Section 1: final result comparison
----------------------------------
loop1:
final result (45):
28 points for "No. of cycle". It is fine if there are 10 less/more cycles. After that, 1 point is lost for each cycle difference. 
17 points for the rest of the final result.

loop2:
final-result (5):
3 points for "No. of cycle".
2 points for the rest of the final result.

loop3:
final-result (4):
2 points for "No. of cycle".
2 points for the rest of the final result.

hidden1:
final-result (2):
1 points for "No. of cycle".
1 points for the rest of the final result.

hidden2:
final-result (2)
1 points for "No. of cycle".
1 points for the rest of the final result.

Section 2: cycle-by-cycle comparison
------------------------------------
Cycle-by-cycle policy:
Results (rdump + mdump) are checked, and they should exactly match the reference sim. For each test input, if the only mismatch is "Instructions Retired", 80% of the points are awarded. If all the cycles match, full points are awarded. If there are mismatches but no more than 2, 90% of the points are awarded. Otherwise, if more than 70% of the cycles match, 70% of the points are awarded. If between 40%-70% of the cycles match, 40% of the points are awarded. Otherwise, no points are awarded.
